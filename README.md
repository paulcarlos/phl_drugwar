# Codes and processed data for the study on Excess Deaths during Philippine War on Drugs

## R Codes
1. Selection of knots for drug war period and degrees of freedom for seasonality per province based on lowest qAIC
2. Classical ITS modeling using quasi Poisson regression and calculation of excess deaths
3. Creating figures 1 and 2 of excess deaths

## Data (no raw data included)
1. Processed excess deaths per week per province ("an_prov_dutwk_v2.rds")
2. Processed ACLED drug war deaths per week per province ("acleds_daily_drugwar_2016-2020.rds") - based on data downloaded in 2025-11-10
3. Shapefile of the Philippines (too large to upload)
4. Plots of associations for drug war period in PDF ("plot_its_prov_rr.pdf")
